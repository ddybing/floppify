# Floppify

The main objective of this project is to create a bootable collection of the operating systems created in IKT218. 

This repository should contain a collection of scripts and/or tools that can retrieve the source code of these operating systems, compile them and then write them together with a Multiboot-compatible boot loader (likely GRUB Legacy) to a physical floppy diskette. 

The goal is to be able to boot these operating systems on a physical machine (the older, the better).
